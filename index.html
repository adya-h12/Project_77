                Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. 
                Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, 
                snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. You can set up visual studio code by going to 
                (https://code.visualstudio.com/). When you open it, you will first see a download button. Click on 
                it and it will download a folder. Open the folder and Visual Studio Code will get downloaded to your
                computer.
